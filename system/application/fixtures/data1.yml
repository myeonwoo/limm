      Hello everyone! My name is Test, and I go to school at
      Test Institute of Technology in the US.
      I just found CodeIgniter some time last week and have been
      reading through the documentation trying to get myself acquainted.

      Hopefully the forums will be a great help! I already have some questions.
      Thanks!
